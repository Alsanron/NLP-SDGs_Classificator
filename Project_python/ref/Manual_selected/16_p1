This Chapter describes the responsibilities of key national actors with integrity-related functions in Ecuador, which are assigned to different branches of the State. It illustrates the co-operation mechanisms set up between them, and how the creation of a National Integrity and Anti-corruption System could address their limits and enable national dialogue and co-operation across states branches and levels of administration on public integrity. The Chapter also analyses the integrity objectives which have been formulated in the National Development Plan 2017-2021 and in the National Public Integrity and Anti-corruption Plan 2019-2023 but have not generated the expected impact. It thus considers how to develop, in a progressive and participative manner, a strategic approach steered by the National Integrity and Anti-corruption System and leading to a long-term integrity vision for Ecuador.
