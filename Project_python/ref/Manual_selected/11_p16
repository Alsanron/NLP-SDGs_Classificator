Maximising Sknes growth potential requires integrated policies to build a high-quality living environment. Sknes current population of 1.2 million is forecast to rise to more than 1.3 million by 2020. This increase over 12 000 people per year will put additional pressure on public services and regional resources. Upcoming investments, including the opening of high level research facilities and new transport corridors, have the potential to draw additional inflows of people who, if fully productively integrated into the regional economy, could generate considerable spill-over effects. Such growth, however, will not come automatically. Preparations for the next regional development programme open a unique window of opportunity for Skne; an opportunity to cultivate a holistic vision, to ensure that potential complementarities are exhausted and investments are mutually reinforcing. Creating an attractive environment to achieve its aim of becoming a vibrant and innovative regional hub, Skne must build on its existing strengths: enhancing accessibility; protecting the environment; and promoting attractiveness through improved housing, spatial planning and branding.
