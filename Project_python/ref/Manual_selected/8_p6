Active labour market policies (ALMPs) will be vital in shaping the labour market recovery from the COVIDâ€‘19 crisis. Connecting people to jobs through effective training, assisting companies to retain and recruit staff, and providing comprehensive support to people with major employment obstacles, will help to ensure an equitable and efficient emergence from the crisis, avoiding labour market detachment of more vulnerable individuals. Many countries reacted swiftly in increasing funding for their public employment services (PES), training programmes, hiring subsidies and other measures to increase labour demand. PES have hired additional staff and expanded remote and digital accessibility to their services to ensure service continuity. This chapter draws on a cross-country survey of policy responses to the crisis to highlight areas of good practice and institutional features that facilitated the development of contingency plans and adjustment to the new environment.
