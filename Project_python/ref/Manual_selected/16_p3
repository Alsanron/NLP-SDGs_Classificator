tackling the grip of criminality on criminal justice systems by creating a datadriven dynamic for justice and incentivising the meting out of justice objective ensuring justice systems in developing countries prevent rather than aggravate human rights abuses to achieve this we will create a dynamic for justice that creates a momentum that will endure implementation and methodologies accountability we will work to extend due process and trial monitoring by professional trial monitors to lay monitors using smartphone apps these apps will inform about correct criminal procedures provide checklists and have a reporting facility the data which comes in will be analysed to reveal patterns of incorrect procedure mistreatment and perversions of justice this will be complement by extracting data from inexpensive digital case management systems provided to courts police and prosecutors to monitor rights compliance and by deep machine learning and predictive legal analytics that uses artificial intelligence to examine data from past just cases to make predictions about the likely outcome of a prosecution if a case is handled fairly and impartially this in no way replaces judges but by calculating statistical variances or deviations for individual judges from aipredicted outcomes those who may be incompetent corrupt etc can be identified professional trial monitors will then target judges thereby making better use of resources to improve accountability and through crossreferencing data from the apps case management systems and predictive analytics data accuracy can be far better assured in order to also bring police and prosecutors to account incentivising justice our innovative use of blockchain and cryptocurrency will incentivise justice as currently in most developingworld jurisdictions incentives such as bribes and promotion favour injustice this will be done on four levels 1 incentivise compliance with fundamental rights by officials judges prosecutors police and lawyers will have an easily recognisable vested interest in a legal system that complies with fundamental rights 2 incentivise objective monitoring of legal systems by professionals trial monitoring must be professionalised and standardised but with safeguards that ensure the highest ethical standards 3 incentivise learning about fundamental rights by citizens and their engagement in compliance using a blockchain platform rewards will be introduced for the comprehension of fundamental rights ratings of officials based on that understanding and reports on compliance levels 4 incentivise initiatives to make 1 2 and 3 viable by offering financial rewards for private sector social enterprise initiatives a network of highly committed and motivated players working collaboratively will be formed dynamically led and carefully coordinated these will include lawyers and paralegals locally based ngos community leaders technology companies legal services companies aid funders social entrepreneurs courts police and prosecutors followup mechanisms having rigorously tested the initiative at pilot stage monitored outputs and evaluated outcomes it will then be scaled up to national level before being adopted in other countries after suitable adjustments have been made governance mechanisms relating to theory of change the correct use of evidence value for money evaluation risk mitigation optimising learning ethics enforcement due diligence and performance improvement will be strictly adhered to
