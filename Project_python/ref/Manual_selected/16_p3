Controlling corruption is a key condition for strong competitiveness. This chapter on anti-corruption policy assesses the policy strategies, regulations, processes and institutions in the six Western Balkan economies (WB6). It starts with a brief overview of trends and performance in the fight against corruption, including the economies performance against international anti-corruption indicators. The chapter then focuses on five essential sub-dimensions. The first, anti-corruption policy framework, examines anti-corruption policies: how they are planned, monitored and co-ordinated, including civil society involvement. The second, prevention of corruption, assesses corruption prevention bodies and key policy areas conflicts of interest, asset and interest disclosure, and protection of whistle-blowers. The third, independence of the judiciary, covers laws, institutions and practices that safeguard the judiciary against undue interference. The fourth, business integrity and corporate liability, considers how private sector actors can be discouraged from corrupt actions and helped to tackle corruption challenges. Finally, the investigation and prosecution sub-dimension considers the readiness and track record of the economies in investigating, prosecuting and adjudicating high-level corruption, including whether there are independent and effective investigation and prosecutorial bodies. The chapter includes suggestions for enhancing policies to tackle corruption in each of these sub-dimensions, which in turn will help foster greater competitiveness.
