Measurement helps manufacturing companies to define objectives and monitor progress towards sustainable production. This chapter reviews the existing sets of indicators that help them track and benchmark their environmental performance. There is no ideal single set of indicators which covers all of the aspects which companies need to address to improve their production processes and products/services. An appropriate combination of elements of existing indicator sets could help them gain a more comprehensive picture of economic, environmental and social effects across the value chain and product life cycle.
