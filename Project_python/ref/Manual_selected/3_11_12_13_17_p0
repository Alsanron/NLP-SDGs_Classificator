the main objective of the proposed project is to enhance ugandas capacity to tackle the twin challenge of air pollution and climate change the specific objectives are to support nema to fasttrack the development and finalization of the national ambient air quality regulations and standards to address both ghg emissions and slcps ii support the unfccc national focal point ministry of water and environment in the review and update of the ndc to consider ghg emissions and slcps in industry transport and waste sectors iii provide training to relevant officials of nema and 5 other relevant lead agencies on effective strategies for monitoring and enforcement of the ambient are quality regulations and regulations on ozone depleting substancesproducts iv support compliance promotion education and awareness among the regulated sectors on better air quality management the accelerated action will be implemented through integraded climate change and air pollution mitigation steps and analysis which include i estimation of annual emissions of pm 25 and o3 within kampala city ii development of of baseline scenarios for kampala city industry transport and waste iii evaluation of the mitigation potential of kcca iv identification of additional policies and measures providing further mitigation potential and benefits including ch4 hcf and bc measures v quantification of the change in ghg emissions slcps and air pollutant emissions from implementing the measures vi quantification of the multiple benefits from implementing the measures climate air quality public health among others and vii prioritization and selection of the package of mitigation measures and tar the expected project outcomes are i enhanced institutional and regulatory capacity for air quality management in uganda ghg emission reduction and control of slcp and ii increased knowledge on air quality management ghg emission reduction and control of slcp within regulated sector
