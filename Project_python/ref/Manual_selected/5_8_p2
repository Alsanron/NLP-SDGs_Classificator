The empirical literature clearly supports a positive relationship between gender equality and development. Empowering women and securing formal work and fair wages for them have tremendous implications for poverty alleviation in any country. Increasing female employment offers large gains to the community, as women are more prone to invest in education, health and nutrition for their families. In Uganda, women with traditional female jobs earn three times less than women working in male dominated sectors. World Bank estimates suggest that 100-150 million people could be lifted out of poverty if
women on a global level had equal access to productive resources (e.g. seeds, fertilizer, and extension services). However, progress towards eliminating gender-based disadvantages has been slow and uneven. In general, gender inequality is highest in LDCs and lowest in
industrialized countries. China stands out for its significant progress in reducing both gender discrimination and extreme poverty.
