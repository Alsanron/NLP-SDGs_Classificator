Improving transport connectivity in developing countries is crucial to reduce trade costs, boost economic growth, and promote regional integration. Therefore, to address various deficiencies in transport connectivity, numerous regional or sub-regional plans have been established. These are supported and financed by many development partners, particularly to fill the large financing gap. At the same time, due to the wide geographical coverage, there are specific issues in transport connectivity that need to be addressed, such as environmental and social concerns, coordination and harmonisation, debt sustainability, trade and investment policies, and technological innovation. Development partners - including those beyond the Development Assistance Committee - could further enhance co-ordination at the partner country level as well as through collective mechanisms. They could also address ways to help improve the enabling environment in order mobilise private investment for transport connectivity, particularly for the poorer countries.
