Biodiversity offsets are economic instruments used to allow for some continued economic development whilst simultaneously delivering biodiversity objectives, such as no net loss or net gain. This chapter discusses the role of biodiversity offsets in the broader policy framework for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, summarises their scale and scope, and highlights some important environmental and social safeguards relevant to their use. Drawing on insights from more than 40 case studies of biodiversity offset programmes worldwide, the chapter concludes with good practice insights for their effective design and implementation.
