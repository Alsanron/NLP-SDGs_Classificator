As industrialization evolves, the quality of jobs tends to improves. Besides having higher wages, manufacturing jobs typically provide better benefits (e.g., retirement plans, paid holidays, etc.) and security (e.g., life and health insurance, etc.) than jobs in other sectors, and tend to develop higher levels of skills than equivalent jobs in the rest of the economy. Globally, manufacturing accounts directly for 15-20% of
total employment, with the manufacturing sectorâ€™s potential for direct employment generation being inversely related to the level of income per capita. The
employment impact of industrialization is multiplied through the productive linkages that manufacturing has with other sectors. Job-centred or labour-intensive growth has been advocated as an effective poverty reduction strategy. Developing with jobs. An ILO study covering 145 developing countries from 1980-2013 finds fundamental empirical regularities
characterising their structural development trajectories: What sets different income categories of developing countries apart is job quality. These qualitative changes
seem to move together, with job quality being better in manufacturing and weaker in informal sectors. From a policy perspective, the study suggests that registration and formalization can be a driver of improved job quality. Enhanced security in employment, and therefore enhanced duration of employment, increases capabilities through learning by doing effects and therefore productivity. Registration of workers is seen as a policy instrument enabling them potentially to access social protection, minimum wages and benefit from national legislation on improved conditions and rights
