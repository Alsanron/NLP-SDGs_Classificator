Due to existing socio-economic conditions, cultural beliefs and traditional practices, women and men are affected differently by disasters. Productive resources tend to be owned by men, and losses in the informal sector and subsistence farming, dominated by women, are not often recorded at all. Despite being disadvantaged by economic,
social and cultural factors, women can serve as agents of change and their role in disaster preparedness and relief both at family and community level is well documented. Women represented an estimated 61% of fatalities in Myanmar after Cyclone Nargis in 2008, and 70% after the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami in Banda Aceh. The 1991 cyclone Gorky in Bangladesh killed 140,000 people. Within the age group 20-44, the female death rate was 71 per 1000, compared to 15 per 1000 for men.
