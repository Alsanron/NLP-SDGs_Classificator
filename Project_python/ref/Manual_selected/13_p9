Over 90 percent of global disaster-related costs for 2013 were hydrological, meteorological or climatological in origin. In Anguilla the predicted annual average losses attributable to cyclone wind doubles with climate change, while Trinidad and

Rising sea level will exacerbate the risks particularly for lowlying areas, and since 1870, average global sea level has risen by about 8 inches. According to some estimates up to 118 million extremely poor people in sub-Saharan Africa will be exposed to drought, flood and extreme heat hazards in 2030.
