This chapter assesses Paraguays open government strategies and initiatives within the broader context of the ongoing public sector reform agenda. It benchmarks Paraguay against OECD standards, principles and instruments, most notably the ten provisions of the 2017 OECD Recommendation of the Council on Open Government. The chapter recognises the Technical Planning Secretariat as the key actor for the co-ordination of open government strategies and initiatives in Paraguay and identifies a number of significant achievements, including the incorporation of open government principles in Paraguays 2030 National Development Plan, the creation of Municipal Development Councils as well as the countrys ambitious Open State agenda. The chapter also finds that there is a need to foster the institutionalisation of Open Government and guarantee the sustainability of ongoing efforts, including by reforming the National Open Government Roundtable and by improving the monitoring and evaluation of open government strategies and initiatives.
