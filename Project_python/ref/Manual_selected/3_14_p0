Healthy marine ecosystems are crucial to biodiversity and to counteracting and reducing the impacts of climate change. They also provide sustenance to human communities and support the development of a sustainable blue economy. The growth of litter and toxic substances in the oceans is not only damaging fragile maritime ecosystems but also affecting human health, especially that of children and pregnant women. Ensuring womens access to leadership positions and empowering women action on the oceans are fundamental to allow them to play a key role in protecting marine ecosystems, tackling marine litter and promoting sustainable fishing.
