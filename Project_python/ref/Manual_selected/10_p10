Rising inequality. The entire 2030 agenda is threatened by rising inequalities in income and wealth. Since 1980, not withstanding some gains at the lowest parts of the income distribution of the global population, income inequality has risen sharply. Although the poorest 50 per cent of the world population did see incomes rise significantly (primarily due to high growth in Asia), they only received a 12 per cent share of the global gains,
while the richest 1 per cent of the world population received 27 per cent.71 Growing wealth and income inequality has been primarily driven by concentration at the top. In the 1980s, the richest 1 per cent of the world population had 28 per cent of total wealth, but by 2017, they had 33 per cent, while the bottom 75 per cent had stagnated around only 10 per cent.72 For individuals caught between the two extremes – primarily the
middle classes in Western Europe and the United States – the period was marked by, at best, sluggish income growth.
