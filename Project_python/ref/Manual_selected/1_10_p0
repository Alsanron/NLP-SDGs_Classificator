Slovenia has a low level of income inequality in old age and is close to the OECD averages regarding relative poverty and material deprivation for older people. Old-age poverty is particularly concentrated among older people living alone. The levels of both the minimum pension and safety-net benefits for older people are relatively high in international comparison, although the coverage rate of the safety net is low. This is likely a result of the obligation of family members to provide support. The old-age safety net and the pension scheme are not sufficiently coordinated, with safety-net eligibility thresholds currently exceeding the minimum pension after a full career and with differing eligibility ages for women. Moreover, part of the old-age safety-net benefits is only available to people who are not in paid work, which discourages eligible people from engaging in formal employment.
