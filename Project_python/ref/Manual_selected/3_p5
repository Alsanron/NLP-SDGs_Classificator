Building higher quality and more efficient mental health care demands a focus on building the innovative and high-performing mental health systems of the future. A future focused approach to mental health includes developing a strong mental health workforce for future generations, investments in research, a strong data infrastructure, and a commitment to innovation and integrating new ideas into mental health practice. At the same time, there is more to do to ensure that more people get access to what is already understood to be the best practice care available, and that this care is delivered in the most effective and efficient way possible. This chapter explores the approaches that OECDÂ countries are already taking to build efficient and sustainable mental health systems, opportunities to maximise uptake of effective and innovative treatment and services, and areas where more investment of attention and resources are needed.
