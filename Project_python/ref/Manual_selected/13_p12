Global Sustainable Development Report 2019 to hundreds of times higher than averaged over the past 10 million years. Animal pollinators, for example, account for up to $577 billion of global crop production worldwide, and contribute to the production of medicines, fibres and biofuels, as well as to the quality of culture and recreation.112 According to IPBES estimates, pollinators of 75 per cent of crops are being threatened.
The overall biodiversity picture across all global regions is grim (see figures 1-7 and 1-8). Globally, local varieties and breeds of domesticated plants and animals are disappearing. Loss of diversity, including genetic diversity, poses a serious risk to
global food security as it undermines the resilience of agricultural systems to pests, pathogens and climate change. This unprecedented loss of biodiversity is driven by several interrelated factors: change in land and water use, overexploitation of resources, climate change, pollution and emergence of invasive species (see figure 1-7). It is likely that most of the Aichi Biodiversity Targets for the period 2011â€“2020, adopted
at the tenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biodiversity, held in Aichi Prefecture, Japan, in October 2010, will be missed, although supporting conservation of biodiversity for future generations is key for sustainable development.
