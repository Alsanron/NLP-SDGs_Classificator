Harmful alcohol use is a growing public health issue in Brazil. There are worrying signs that consumption has increased in all population groups in recent years, particularly for heavy episodic drinking among adults. While Brazil adopted important and effective alcohol control policies including drink driving policy or mass media campaigns, there remains scope to improve. Implementing a more comprehensive alcohol policy package, including pricing policies, limiting advertising and introducing regulation of alcohol sports sponsorship, can help tackle harmful alcohol consumption in Brazil. Embedding more systematically screening and brief interventions in primary health care, and implementing education and awareness programmes, are other key strategies to combat alcohol consumption and reduce its harmful consequences in Brazil.
