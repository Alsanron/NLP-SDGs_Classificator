available evidence estimates the direct costs of safety lapses the additional tests, treatments and health care in primary and ambulatory care to be around 2.5% of total health expenditure. safety lapses resulting in hospitalisations each year may count 6% of total hospital bed days and more than 7 million admissions in the oecd. in chile, cancer is the second leading cause of death and could become the first cause in the near future. in order to reduce the disease burden, chile could do more to prevent many deaths due to cancer through cancer screening and prevention. this chapter describes the epidemiological burden of cancer in chile, assesses the governance of chilean cancer care system and public health policies in terms of prevention and early detection of cancer based on cross national comparisons, and concludes with a number of policy recommendations which could help chile strengthen cancer screening and prevention.
