Recent and projected trends in natural hazards-induced disasters (NHID) underscore the importance of building agricultural resilience through disaster risk management (DRM) that strengthens the ability of farmers and other agricultural sector stakeholders to prepare and plan for NHID; to absorb, respond to and recover from their impacts; and to more successfully adapt and transform in response to the risk of future NHID. This chapter sets out the approach that was used to identify good practices at all stages of the DRM cycle in the seven case study countries. Specifically, it proposes four Principles for Effective Disaster Risk Management for Resilience, which are based on recommendations and principles in key international frameworks for managing the risks posed by disasters.
