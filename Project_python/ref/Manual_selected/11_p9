Promoting and sustaining inclusive growth is a pre-condition for a fair and inclusive industrial transition. This chapter assesses how adopting an integrated territorial approach to economic development and enhancing individual well-being and labour market inclusion can help regions in industrial transition overcome obstacles to inclusive growth. The chapter points out that less advantaged areas those that might have been prosperous prior to industrial decline must solidify ties with those that are now growing. It also highlights that vulnerable groups need to better integrate into the labour market. The chapter further explores how improved urban-rural linkages, better (digital) connectivity, dedicated support for vulnerable groups in transition and stronger coherence in promoting inclusive growth policies can support regions in industrial transition mitigate the effects of slow growth and high unemployment.
