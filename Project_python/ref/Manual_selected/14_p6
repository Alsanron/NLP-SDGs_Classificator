This chapter presents the main characteristics and trends of the Peruvian fisheries sector, including fish farming and freshwater fishing in Amazonia, as well as the institutional framework for fisheries policies. Despite the progress made in the management of some fisheries resources, such as anchovy, the creation of marine protected areas, and the environmental regulation of the fish industries, environmental performance suffers from a lack of information on endangered aquatic species and the presence of an informal economy. The chapter calls for a strategy for integrated management of the marinecoastal ecosystem.
