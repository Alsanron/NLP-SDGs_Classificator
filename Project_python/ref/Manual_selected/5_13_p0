The impact of climate change and large-scale environmental hazards is intensifying and taking a growing toll on economies and livelihoods. The impacts are not gender neutral, and women often bear a greater burden because of their more vulnerable social and economic status and their role in society. At the same time, women can be powerful agents for climate action, both at the grassroots level and as decision-makers in the public and private sectors. Climate strategies and policies, therefore, need to incorporate a gender perspective, and better gender disaggregated data on climate impact and action is needed.
