Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a serious threat to fisheries and fisheries-dependent communities that impairs the development of a sustainable ocean economy. Eradicating IUU fishing requires closing waters and markets to IUU operators and the products they harvest globally. Based on a survey conducted in 2019, this chapter reviews the policies that countries and economies apply in the fight against IUU fishing and evaluates the extent to which internationally-recognised best practices in some of the most important areas for government intervention against IUU fishing have been adopted. It identifies the regulatory loopholes and policy gaps that need to be addressed and provides information on effective measures that could be adapted and replicated across countries and economies.
