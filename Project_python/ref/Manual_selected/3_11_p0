safe travel for all road users is a prerequisite for ensuring sustainable and inclusive cities. providing safe transport system is an objective for sustainable transport, because risk of injuries and deaths from traffic crashes has become a major public health concern worldwide (who, 2011). at the same time safety of pedestrians, bicyclists and public transport users also has an impact on the choice of these modes. risk to pedestrians, bicyclists and public transport users can be reduced by appropriate street designs and neighbourhood environment. safer pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure results in increased use of these environment friendly modes (tiwari & jain, 2012). safe travel options for women in general and specifically low income women are important for addressing livelihood and poverty issues for a significant proportion of urban population in low income countries like india.
