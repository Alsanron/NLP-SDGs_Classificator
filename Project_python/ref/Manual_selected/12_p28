The OECD Green Growth indicators in this area focus on: Carbon and energy productivity, which characterises, among other things, interactions with the climate system and the global carbon cycle as well as the environmental and economic efficiency with which energy resources are used in production and consumption, and which informs about the results of policies that promote low carbon technologies and cleaner energy. Resource productivity, which characterises the environmental and economic efficiency with which natural resources and materials are used in production and consumption, and which informs about the results of policies and measures that promote resource productivity and sustainable materials management in all sectors. Important resources and materials include mineral resources (metallic minerals, industrial minerals, construction minerals); biotic resources (food, feed, wood); water; and nutrients, which among other characteristics reflect interactions with nutrient cycles and food production systems. Environmentally adjusted multi-factor productivity to give a more complete picture of the productivity of an economy by accounting for inputs from natural resources and for the generation of pollution. Other issues of importance include consumer behaviour, household and government consumption patterns, and societal responses. Examples of related response indicators are given as complements to illustrate their link with environmental and resource productivity indicators.
