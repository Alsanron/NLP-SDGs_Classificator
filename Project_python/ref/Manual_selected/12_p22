Encouraging innovation in material recycling and waste management technologies has been on the agenda in many countries for several decades. In this chapter, the data presented indicate the possibility that the first wave of policies (end of the 1980s, beginning of the 1990s) has produced an innovation response, but their effect is now less pronounced. Technological maturity of this sector, relative to other areas of environmental innovation, is one possible explanation for this finding. Nonetheless, in many countries recycling rates have increased and waste generation per unit of economic activity is beginning to fall. It is likely, that for mature sectors responses to environmental policy shocks may be reflected in behavioural and organisational innovations, rather than in terms of technological inventions.
