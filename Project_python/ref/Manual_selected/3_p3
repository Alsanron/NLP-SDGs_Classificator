Cancer was the second leading cause of death in OECD countries after circulatory diseases, accounting for 24% of all deaths in 2019. Leading causes of cancer-related mortality included lung cancer (21%), colorectal cancer (11%), breast cancer (15% among women) and prostate cancer (10% among men). These four represent 44% of all cancers diagnosed in OECD countries. Mortality rates from cancer have fallen in all OECDÃ‚ countries since 2000, although on average the decline has been more modest than for circulatory diseases.
