Major structural reforms following the end of the communist period have resulted in an education system that has many features that should result in good educational outcomes and efficient use of resources. Indeed, costs relative to GDP are at about the OECD average, while younger school pupils perform above average in internationally comparable assessments. But this relatively good performance fades with age. Fifteen-year-olds register only average performance in the PISA assessments, and the proportion of adults with tertiary qualifications, though rising, is still low. More worryingly, the school system does not adequately prepare school leavers, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, for the labour market. Encouraging more children from such backgrounds to spend more time in pre-school, raising the age at which school students must choose what type of secondary schooling they will follow, and raising the standards of vocational training would help improve matters, as would continuing steps to improve the average quality of teachers. The co-existence of very high gross wage premia for adults with tertiary qualifications, and the comparatively low numbers graduating, suggest that tertiary education should expand further, and that students in higher education should contribute more to the cost of their studies.
