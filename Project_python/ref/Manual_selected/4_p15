This chapter focuses on policies and practices to ensure coherent provision of migrant education throughout the education system. The country reviews have revealed many examples of promising practices at different levels of education. The challenges ahead will be to learn from these practices and to implement them on a wider scale. Of critical importance are political leadership, adequate resources and incentives, knowledge management and clear policies informed by a strong evidence base. The first section of this chapter is dedicated to promising policies and practices in the area of managing variations and concentration. Ensuring equal opportunities for all immigrant students regardless of which school they attend is of critical importance. The second section, on funding strategy, presents approaches to managing inequities through targeted funding to disadvantaged areas, schools or particular student groups after careful consideration of educational priorities. Finally, the third section underlines the importance of monitoring and evaluation in ensuring the quality of migrant education. This includes improving the quality of data on outcomes and effective policies as well as training practitioners to effectively exploit this information. In combination, these three areas play a key role in managing the system to provide high quality education to immigrant students.
