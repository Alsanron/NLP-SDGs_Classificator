a report is given on the recent discovery of outstanding immunological properties in ba ncyanoethyleneurea having a low molecular mass m experiments in ds CS bearing wistar rats have shown that ba at a dosage of only about percent ld mg kg and negligible lethality percent results in a REC rate of percent without hyperglycemia and in one test of percent with hyperglycemia under otherwise unchanged conditions the REF substance ifosfamide if a further development of cyclophosphamide applied without hyperglycemia in its most efficient dosage of percent ld mg kg brought about a recovery rate of percent at a lethality of percent contrary to ba min hyperglycemia caused no further improvement of the REC rate however this comparison is characterized by the fact that both substances exhibit two quite different complementary mechanisms of action leucocyte counts made T3 application of the said cancerostatics and dosages have shown a pronounced stimulation with ba and with ifosfamide the known suppression in the posttherapeutic interval usually found with standard cancerostatics in combination with the cited PI test for ba blood pictures then allow conclusions on the immunity status since if can be taken as one of the most efficient cancerostaticsthere is no other chemotherapeutic known up to now that has a more significant effect on the ds carcinosarcoma in rats these findings are of special importance finally the total amount of leucocytes and lymphocytes as well as their time behaviour was determined from the blood picture of tumourfree rats after iv application of ba the thus obtained numerical values clearly show that further research work on the prophylactic use of this substance seems to be necessary and very promising
