This chapter begins by assessing the evidence of urban sprawl in Puebla-Tlaxcala, followed by an analysis of its causes and consequences and concludes with a series of potential strategies for better managing urban growth. Factors in Puebla-Tlaxcala contributing to the development of urban sprawl include, inter alia, rising incomes, lower transport costs, federal housing policies and limited municipal capacity for land-use planning. Meanwhile, its consequences are evident in terms of increased traffic congestion, higher costs for infrastructure provision, inadequate service delivery, increasing environmental pressures and significant intra-metropolitan territorial inequalities. Strategies for guiding urban growth more effectively include: i) linking opportunities for land use and transport; ii) tackling the vacancy problem; iii) developing tools to balance the costs and benefits of development; iv) building municipal capacity for planning and land-use management; and v) applying a metropolitan lens to urban planning challenges and solutions.
