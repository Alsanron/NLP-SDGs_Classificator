implementing a more comprehensive alcohol policy package, including pricing policies, limiting advertising and introducing regulation of alcohol sports sponsorship, can help tackle harmful alcohol consumption in brazil. embedding more systematically screening and brief interventions in primary health care, and implementing education and awareness programmes, are other key strategies to combat alcohol consumption and reduce its harmful consequences in brazil. building on published patient safety research literature, this paper aims to broaden the existing knowledge base on safety lapses occurring in primary and ambulatory care settings.the findings of this paper show that safety lapses in primary and ambulatory care are common. about half of the global burden of patient harm originates in primary and ambulatory care, and estimates suggest that nearly four out of ten patients experience safety issue(s) in their interaction with this setting. safety lapses in primary and ambulatory care most often result in an increased need for care or hospitalisations.
