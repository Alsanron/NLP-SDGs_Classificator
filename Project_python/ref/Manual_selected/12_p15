Even as the concept of sustainable development has gained ground in recent decades, global consumption and production trends are unsustainable, as measured by such
indicators as total material consumption, material footprints, and environmental impacts of various types. The global increase in consumer demand has closely followed global economic growth and thus far dematerialization and reduction in energy intensity of economic activity (or relative decoupling) have not been enough to offset what has been a huge increase in absolute volumes. Absolute decoupling of economic growth from resource use and environmental degradation has yet to occur globally. Shifting to more sustainable patterns of consumption and production is an established commitment of the international community since the Earth Summit in 1992. Currently, member states are also considering the topic of sustainable consumption and production (SCP) for the post 2015 agenda including a stand-alone Goal – Sustainable Development Goal 12 – and a range of targets that clearly embody the importance of a shift to SCP patterns.
