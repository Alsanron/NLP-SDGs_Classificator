This chapter identifies, documents and provides estimates of the various subsidies in Armenia that relate to the production or use of coal, oil and related petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity and heat generated on the basis of these fossil fuels. The chapter also briefly looks at the subsidies benefiting energyefficiency measures and renewable energy sources. An overview of the country's energy sector is first given to place the measures listed into context. In addition, the chapter discusses pricing and tax policies in the energy sector in Armenia. The analysis summarises the context, the state of play, and the mechanics of the complex and evolving landscape of energy subsidies in the country.
