Cities present both a pressing challenge for sustainable mobility and a great opportunity for creating a Safe System of road traffic. Already, major world cities are becoming Safe System laboratories, testing the viability of designing, communicating, managing and living the Safe System approach in complex communities. With continuing urbanisation in high-income countries and rapid demographic growth and urbanisation in many middle- and low-income countries combined with unprecedented motorisation, there is an urgent need to establish a road safety paradigm in which pedestrians and cyclists can equitably and safely share the public space of cities with motor vehicles.
