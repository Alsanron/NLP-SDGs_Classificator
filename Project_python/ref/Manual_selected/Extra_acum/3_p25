however, the existence of actions and programmes in mental health promotion and prevention is uneven both between countries, and across different points of the life course. many countries could stand to scale up their promotion and prevention efforts in the mental health field, and further efforts are particularly needed to introduce interventions targeted at unemployed and older populations. mental ill health is a significant issue in sweden, with both mild to moderate and severe disorders representing a significant burden of ill health. mild and moderate mental health problems constitute the greatest number of cases, and such disorders have been on the rise over the past several decades. however, mental ill health is also recognised as a vital national issue by swedish authorities. accordingly, sweden has a relatively comprehensive approach to mental health as part of its universal health plan.
