Another significant factor affecting structural transformation is globalization. The rapid globalization process of the past several decades has reshaped global economic geography. Domestic economies are increasingly interwoven with the global economic system, and centres of innovation and growth are more dispersed. Production patterns have been driven primarily by the emergence of transnational corporations and global value chains (GVCs) linked through trade and investment flows. Many countries have benefited from this process, while others remain marginalized. According to UNIDO study, the 30 developing countries that successfully integrated in GVCs and showed the highest participation rates grew almost five times faster than the 30 bottom countries. A large part of Chinaâ€™s rapid structural transformation is attributed to the ability of its producers to link to global value chains. Over the years, China has successfully diversified its production to cover entire value chains through backward and forward integration. Patterns of international trade are changing towards increasing trade activity between developing countries. Two trends are clear. First, Africa is emerging as a point of interest for trade, especially for China, India and Brazil. Secondly, the expanding middle class in developing countries represents a major consumer market for which an intense race has already started. All developing countries stand to benefit from strengthening regional trade as an important channel for trade in consumer goods and infrastructure services, and the development of regional value chains.
