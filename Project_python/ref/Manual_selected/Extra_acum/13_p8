Agricultural producers in Japan have significant experience in managing the risk of natural hazard-induced disasters (NHID), but recent large-scale typhoons and heavy rain events have highlighted the importance of increasing the sectors resilience to NHID. The chapter explores current good practices that already build the resilience of Japans agricultural sector to typhoons and heavy rain and NHID more broadly at each stage of the disaster risk management cycle, and identifies further opportunities that would better position the sector to prepare for, mitigate and manage the risks of more frequent and intense typhoons and heavy rains.
