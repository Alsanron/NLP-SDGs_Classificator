Greece has a decentralised system of environmental governance. The government has made significant efforts to increase transparency and accountability and to streamline environmental legislation so as to reduce the regulatory burden on enterprises. However, institutional capacity issues and resource constraints limit effective implementation of environmental law and use of good regulatory practices, particularly in compliance assurance. This chapter analyses the institutional and regulatory framework for environmental management, the setting and enforcement of environmental requirements, and mechanisms of public participation in decision making, access to environmental information, education and justice.
