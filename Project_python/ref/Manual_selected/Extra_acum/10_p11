To sustain and further improvements in living standards and well-being, Paraguay will need to review its social protection policies and transform them into a coherent system for all. This chapter analyses social protection in Paraguay and provides policy recommendations to foster coherence, equity and an integrated system. Social protection is split along the line of informality, leaving parts of society unprotected. Formal dependent workers are covered by social security, whose fragmentation results in unequitable provisions. The high degree of self-employment limits the reach of social security, while informality and evasion further reduce its coverage. Means-tested social assistance needs to be better targeted and scaled up to fully address the needs of the population not covered by social security. Key bottlenecks to expand social protection to the whole population are its governance, insufficient financial resources for social assistance and the inclusion of independent workers into social security. Independent workersâ€™ low and unstable incomes, as well as the systems design itself are barriers to the inclusion of independent workers.
