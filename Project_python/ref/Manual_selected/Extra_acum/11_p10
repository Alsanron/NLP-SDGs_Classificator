The purpose of this chapter is to understand current regional development approaches among OECD countries to help lagging regions catch up and improve the quality of life for residents in all regions. It reviews the objectives and policy tools for regional, urban and rural development as well as trends in country practices and the nature of recent changes. It then explores the governance arrangements to underpin better policies, such as the organisation of such policies at national level, the role of national networks of regional development agencies, and reforms of regions in terms of competencies and administrative borders.
