Good governance is a Sustainable Development Goal in itself – Goal 16 – that calls for promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels. At the same time, governance is recognized as the means to a broader end; it is an essential lever of the systemic transformations needed to achieve all 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The 2030 Agenda represents a new mode of governance, one ultimately defined not through legally binding international agreements, but through goals. Governance by goals holds great potential, but success will depend on a number of institutional factors, including how States act on their commitments to the 2030 Agenda and how they strengthen related global governance arrangements and translate global ambitions into their national, subnational and local contexts. Governments will need to prioritize policy coherence, overcome sectoral silos and align existing rules and regulations towards achieving the goals that are interlinked across sectors. New integrated approaches that take into account systemic interactions and causal relationships between goals and policies are needed. Governments will need to be open to transformative learning through experimentation and innovation, a mode of working that may be new for many government entities. Adequate State capacity is among the key factors for successful sustainable development policies
