This chapter sets out possible effects of COVID-19 on the adoption of remote working models and spatial distribution of people and firms, and outlines existent and needed G7 policy responses to benefit from these new trends. The chapter begins by reviewing the results from recent research and surveys on the effects of COVID-19 on remote working adoption and on the spatial decisions of workers and firms.
