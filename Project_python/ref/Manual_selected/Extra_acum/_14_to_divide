Oceans, seas and marine resources are increasingly
threatened, degraded or destroyed by human activities,
reducing their ability to provide crucial ecosystem
services.
169 Important classes of threats identified by
contributing experts were climate change, marine
pollution, unsustainable extraction of marine resources and
physical alterations and destruction of marine and coastal
habitats and landscapes.
One estimate found that at least 40% of the global oceans
are heavily affected by human activities.170 A recent global
analysis of threats to marine biodiversity warns against a
possible future marine mass extinction event driven by
increased human uses of the oceans.
171 Already today, 30%
of the world's fish stocks are over-exploited, while more
than 50% are fully exploited.172 Coastal habitats are under
pressure, with approximately 20% of the world’s coral reefs
lost and another 20% degraded. Mangroves have been
reduced to between 30 to 50% of their historical cover,
impacting biodiversity, habitat for fisheries, coastal
protection from severe weather and tide events and carbon
sequestration potential. Some 30% of seagrass habitats are
estimated to have disappeared since the late 1800.
173 Over
80% of the world’s 232 marine eco-regions report the
presence of invasive species, which is considered the
second most significant cause of biodiversity loss on a
global scale.174
The deterioration of coastal and marine ecosystems and
habitats is negatively affecting human well-being
worldwide, with more severe and immediate impacts on
the vulnerable groups, including the poor, women,
children, and indigenous peoples, due to their often high
dependency on natural resources, lack of alternative
options, and inability to protect themselves from natural
disasters and other threats. Coastal regions and SIDS are
particularly vulnerable to these challenges as oceans, seas
and marine resources play a central role in their culture,
while at the same time being tightly linked to their
economies.
Given the Earth’s limited natural resource base as
suggested by the concept of “planetary boundaries”175, the
foreseen global population growth to 9.6 billion people by
2050176
, the persistence of unsustainable consumption and
production patterns in high-income countries, and the
increased economic “catching up” of developing countries
with related increases in resource demands, are anticipated
to aggravate the situation if no adequate counter measures
are taken.
Coastal regions are more densely populated and experience
higher rates of population growth and urbanization than
the hinterland. This trend is expected to continue.177 Poorly
planned and managed developments of coastal areas can
have detrimental impacts on local marine ecosystems and
the services they provide.

Oceans, seas and marine resources support the human
well-being of all people by contributing to poverty
eradication, food security, the creation of sustainable
livelihoods and jobs, human health and protection from
natural disasters. They are the primary regulator of the
global climate and an important sink for greenhouse gases,
while also providing humans with water and oxygen.
However, marine- and land-based human activities often
threaten ecosystem integrity and hamper the provision of
ecosystem services crucial to humans and sustainable
development.
