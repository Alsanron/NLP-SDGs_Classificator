Digitalisation and the expansion of the digital economy  the convergence of fixed, mobile and broadcast networks, the increasing connectivity of devices and objects, and the changes in social interactions and personal relationships that these developments bring about â€“ are reshaping the manufacturing and services sectors in Emerging Asia. These impacts are seen in the emergence of new ways of doing business and effects on trade and productivity trends. Policy makers in the region seeking to foster the continued responsible development of digitalisation should consider addressing trade restrictions, particularly those affecting trade in services; barriers to investment in the digital economy; the need for the development and reform of physical and regulatory infrastructure; and labour market and social challenges. Optimal policy strategies are likely to differ by country across the region.
