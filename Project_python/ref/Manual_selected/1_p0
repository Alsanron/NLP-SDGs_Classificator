Poverty, extreme poverty and income inequality have declined considerably in the focal countries since 2000, but have remained high. Since around 2014, household income and consumption have stagnated, while satisfaction with living standards began to fall in the region. While until 2019, employment levels were comparatively high in the region, recent data show that the COVID 19 crisis had a negative impact on employment and unemployment. Across Latin America as a whole, more than half of all workers are in informal employment and typically lack access to social programmes and protection against unfair dismissal. Regarding housing quality, on average for the focal countries with available data, only around half of households had access to sanitation services, and only 70% had access to clean drinking water.
