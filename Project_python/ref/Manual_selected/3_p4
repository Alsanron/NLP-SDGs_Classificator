the health impact of covid 19 has been devastating. by mid october 2021, 240 million people had contracted the virus with nearly 4.9 million dying from it. moreover, millions of survivors suffer from long lasting symptoms that prevent a return to normal life. mental distress has increased substantially. there has also been a clear social gradient to the risk of infection and death from the virus. furthermore, covid19 has disrupted health care for people with other needs. for example, cancer screening was frequently delayed, non urgent surgeries postponed, emergency department use dropped, and waiting times for elective surgeries increased. nevertheless, vaccinations have been a game changer in 2021, reducing the risk of severe illness and death. however, vaccination hesitancy among some population groups and waning vaccine effectiveness are an ongoing challenge. building higher quality and more efficient mental health care demands a focus on building the innovative and high performing mental health systems of the future. a future focused approach to mental health includes developing a strong mental health workforce for future generations, investments in research, a strong data infrastructure, and a commitment to innovation and integrating new ideas into mental health practice. at the same time, there is more to do to ensure that more people get access to what is already understood to be the best practice care available, and that this care is delivered in the most effective and efficient way possible. this chapter explores the approaches that oecdã‚ countries are already taking to build efficient and sustainable mental health systems, opportunities to maximise uptake of effective and innovative treatment and services, and areas where more investment of attention and resources are needed.
