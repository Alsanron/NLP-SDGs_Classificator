Many parts of the world are witnessing an increase in extremes of climate, such as greater
extremes of temperature, heavier rainfall, or higher maximum wind speed of storms. This
can result in an increase in natural hazards such as flash flooding, drought, landslide, and storm surge. In most countries, the predicted annual average loss increases under climate change scenarios. But affects will differ country by country. Drought and flood hazards are among the most potent causes for long-term impoverishment, particularly in rural areas.
