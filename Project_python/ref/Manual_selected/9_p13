Evolution of thinking on the role of Industrial Policy for development in past decades In the period since World War II, academic thinking on policies to promote industrial development has gone through several phases. This evolution has in turn shaped policy practice in both developed and developing economies. A stylized laissez faire economic view confines the role of the state to providing an enabling environment for businesses by securing property rights, enforcing contracts, streamlining procedures for starting new enterprises, putting in place effective legal processes for dispute resolution and, under certain circumstances, providing reliable infrastructure. In this view governments should intervene in cases of market failures, due to information asymmetries, existence of public goods, externalities and/or imperfect competition. In practice, few governments have adhered to this stylized model. Most have been activist to some degree in promoting industrial development. This is partly because the notion that countries should be content to specialize in accordance with static comparative advantage is seen as resigning countries to remaining hewers of wood and drawers of water of the international economy.
