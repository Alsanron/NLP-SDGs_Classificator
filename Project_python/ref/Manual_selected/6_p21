Financing has been a recurring theme in international debate on water and has been a key feature of reform efforts in many countries. Increasing access to water supply and sanitation, ensuring the environmental sustainability of water ecosystems, reducing the impacts of floods and drought, and ensuring water is used to maximise welfare across an economy all require financial support. Yet, despite some progress, securing sustainable finance for this wide range of services is an ongoing struggle for most countries, particularly in the current global economic crisis. This chapter examines the policy challenges surrounding the financing of water supply and sanitation and presents a policy toolkit that can underpin policy dialogues to stimulate much needed reform. The chapter also addresses the growing problem of financing the broader water resources management functions of government.
