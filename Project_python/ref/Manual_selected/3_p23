paraguay has set ambitious targets to improve the health of its citizens. the country faces a double burden. the weight of non communicable diseases is growing, fuelled by longer lives but also less healthy lifestyles. at the same time, unresolved issues remain in communicable diseases, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseases. the health system in paraguay suffers from fragmentation and the weaknesses of its stewardship institutions. to measure up to the challenge, the country has undertaken a series of reforms, starting with a landmark law passed in 1996. the reforms have succeeded in setting the stage for a new approach to healthcare based on primary care. however, they have not altered significantly the foundations of the health system and its fragmentation into multiple subsystems. this chapter describes the health challenges that paraguay faces and focuses on challenges in financing healthcare and in achieving universal health coverage. the health, social and economic consequences of poor mental health are substantial. more attention is focusing now on the development of actions to promote better mental health and wellbeing and prevent mental ill health. this paper provides an overview of the development of approaches to promoting mental wellbeing and preventing mental ill health in oecd countries, together with an assessment of what is known on their effectiveness and cost effectiveness. the paper finds that there is a sound and quite extensive evidence base for effective and cost effective actions which can promote mental wellbeing and prevent mental ill health.
