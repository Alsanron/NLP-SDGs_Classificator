Chile has undergone significant transformation in the past three decades, including growth in its GDP, population levels and urbanisation. This growth has been a key factor in the countys success. Chiles urban and metropolitan development practices have traditionally been sector driven, and today the need for well-integrated approaches to urbanism are increasingly recognised among urban policy makers. This chapter makes the case for such an approach to urban development and management as a means to help reduce inequalities within and between urban areas. It provides an overview of the policy and planning frameworks governing urban development in Chile, and analyses four policy areas with significant implications for national urban programming: land use and zoning, housing, public transport and the environment, particularly with respect to air pollution, green space and the risk of natural hazards.
