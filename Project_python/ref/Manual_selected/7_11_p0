Preparing cities and regions for successful environmental and energy transition will require moving large amounts of investment into clean technologies and related infrastructures and away from fossil fuels, carbon-intensive or wasteful activities. This chapter explores how cities and regions can scale-up and deploy financing for transition projects. It discusses some of the barriers subnational governments face in accessing transition finance and how they can be overcome. Finally, it proposes a set of policy levers to meet investment needs and incentivise private investments.
