Jakartas plan for 2010â€“2030 calls for incorporating risk reduction activities into long-term spatial planning for the city; including restoration of mangrove forests, improvement in public facilities and mass transit, refinement of building and environmental regulations that consider hazard risk, redesign of technology and engineering in disaster areas, and improvements of provision of open space for anticipated increases in intense rainfall. Slum populations and their increase in metropolises such as Dhaka or Manila are significantly augmented by flood, storms and drought related migration. Case studies carried out in Dar es Salaam, Jakarta, Mexico City and Sao Paolo found that, in all four cities, those living in informal settlements were most vulnerable to climate related and disaster risk. Case studies in Colombia and Turkey found that structural (i.e. retrofitting) and functional investments (i.e. protection of people and assets so that they remain functional during and after an emergency) not only provide for reduction in property losses, but may also save lives and reduce the number of injuries
