this source global project in partnership with conservation international aims to solve the longstanding challenge of providing access to safe and affordable drinking water to the wayuu community in bahia hondita colombia without impacting existing water sources and protecting the efficient use of natural resources the project builds on an existing partnership between conservation international  colombia and the community that began in 2009 with the support of cerrejon and corpoguajira aimed at boosting the populations of the critically endangered loggerhead sea turtle caretta caretta who nest along the shores of the guajira peninsula near bahia hondita the goal of the project is to increase accessible abundant clean drinking water to improve livelihoods and health and reduce the time and energy that the wayuu spend on collecting water to focus on conservation and living sustainable abundant lives the nearly 500 residents of the wayuu indigenous tribe in bahia hondita colombia faced what seemed to be an impossible set of barriers to providing safe water for their community cut off from the rest of the country with no roads or infrastructure to provide water and electricity they lacked access to piped bottled or even trucked water instead they relied on unsafe brackish water from a local borehole and would spend 3 to 6 hours to access water for human consumption because of the arid dry landscape of bahia hondita people in the area traditionally relied on ground water with dangerously high levels of saline that is unsafe to drink on a regular basis the local water sources are also being threatened by climate change as tropical storms intensify and sea levels continue to rise which pollute and degrade water sources precipitation in guajira has declined further exacerbating the lack of water and a critical river that used to supply water to the area has been heavily disrupted by a dam to support the colombian vice ministry of waters efforts to expand access to drinking water source global in partnership with conservation international installed two communityscale hydropanel arrays of 149 panels to create a source of clean renewable drinking water in bahia hondita la guajira one of the most remote indigenous communities in the region leveraging innovative technology and material science the source hydropanels use only sunlight to produce clean drinking water from the air to provide clean drinking water to the community at no additional cost with no need for a water source and with no additional infrastructure or electricity once installed the hydropanels produce enough drinking water for the community that is localized clean and powered by solar energy that is off the grid the project empowers this remote indigenous community to produce their own clean drinking water on an ongoing basis
