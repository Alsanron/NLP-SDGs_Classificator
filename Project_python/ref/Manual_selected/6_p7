This chapter provides an overview of the financing system for Dutch water management, bringing together data from a variety of sources into a consistent framework. The chapter provides insights into the overall cost of water resources management, across functions and institutions, examines the various sources of financing, and summarises key studies on projected future costs. Based on the OECDs framework for financing water resources management, it also identifies opportunities to improve financial sustainability. Particular attention is paid to the application of the â€œbeneficiary pays and polluter pays principles, as well as incentives for cost efficiency and the fair allocation of costs across water users.
