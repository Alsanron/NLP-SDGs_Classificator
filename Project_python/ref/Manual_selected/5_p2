Gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls are universal goals in their own right, as explicitly set out in Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 in the United Nations Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development (2030 Agenda), the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), and the 1995 Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. The OECD has issued two recommendations on gender: the 2013 Recommendation of the Council on Gender Equality in Education, Employment, and Entrepreneurship, and the 2015 Recommendation of the Council on Gender Equality in Public Life. Yet a 2017 progress report on these recommendations shows that gender disparities and biases against women and girls persist in all fields, and calls for effective actions to remove obstacles to ensure equal and equitable opportunities. Addressing gender inequalities is a social, and economic, imperative.
