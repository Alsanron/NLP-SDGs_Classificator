Energy, as a production input, is an essential element affecting the profitability and competitiveness of the agricultural sector. In addition, agriculture might become an important potential source of renewable energy and thus provide significant economic opportunities for farmers and the rural economy, as well as improving the environment. This Chapter focuses on the issue of energy use and efficiency in agriculture. It presents some empirical evidence on the current situation and trends in energy consumption and energy efficiency for the agricultural sector. It also discusses the efficiency gain potential associated with different product categories (e.g. arable crops, horticulture, meats and dairy) and a number of options to improve energy efficiency on-farm are considered.
