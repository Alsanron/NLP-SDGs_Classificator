Digitalisation will profoundly affect the public sector and the evidence base on which it formulates, implements, monitors and evaluates public policy. The science, technology and innovation (STI) policy field is no exception. In recent years, many countries have begun to develop digital science and innovation policy (DSIP) initiatives, to help build a picture of the incidence and impact of their science and innovation activities. This chapter provides an introductory overview of DSIP systems in OECD member and partner countries. Drawing on the findings of a recent OECD survey of DSIP initiatives, it first outlines the main characteristics of the DSIP systems currently in use and under development. It then describes the promises and challenges of DSIP systems. It shows that much can be gained from this digital transformation by leveraging the untapped potential of data about STI. However, obstacles and risks also exist. These relate to privacy and confidentiality, interoperability standards, and potential misalignment of incentives between policy objectives and STI actors, including the private sector. If DSIP initiatives are to fulfil their future potential, STI policy needs to address these opportunities and challenges, sometimes at the international level. The chapter concludes by considering the outlook for DSIP systems and possible avenues for policy action.
