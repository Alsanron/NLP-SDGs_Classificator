Exposure to inadequate drinking water, sanitation and hygiene behaviours (WASH) are vital to individual health, livelihood and well-being. Diarrhoea, respiratory infections, malnutrition, schistosomiasis, malaria, soil-transmitted helminth infections and trachoma are some of the diseases associated to inadequate WASH. In 132 low and middle-income countries, an estimated 829000 WASH-attributable deaths and 49.8 million DALYs occurred from diarrhoeal diseases in 2016, equivalent to 60% of all diarrhoeal deaths (PrÃ¼ss-UstÃ¼n etal., 2019[20]). Over half a million children under the age of five die every year due to diarrhoeal disease. The estimation is that 88% of that burden is attributable to WASH and is mostly concentrated on children in developing countries. Better access to water and sanitation is fundamental to better health but it also contributes to social and economic progress, one of the many links to human capital described in this publication. It helps drive higher educational enrolment rates, improves the standard of living and lower health care costs necessary to maintain a productive workforce (UNICEF and WHO, 2017[21]).
