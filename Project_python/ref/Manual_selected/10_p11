The increase in income share at the top of the global income distribution is related to several other factors. In the United States, for example, while the productivity of workers has doubled since the 1980s, almost all the gains have gone to executives, owners and investors, while wages for those in production or non-supervisory jobs have stagnated.74, 75 Several factors have contributed to that trend, including globalization, automation, the declining influence of unions, and stagnant federal and state minimum wages. That has led to a substantial hollowing-out of the labour market, with job creation
primarily at the high- and low-skill ends. Increasing inequalities are also apparent in other countries and regions. Researchers have observed an increasing concentration of income in a range of countries with the top 10 per cent trending towards a high-inequality frontier with a Gini-coefficient of over 60.76 In parallel, while income across countries appeared to be converging over the period from 2000 to 2010, such movement has slowed or even reversed in recent years, especially in sub-Saharan Africa compared to the rest of the world. The relationship between inequality and well-being is
complex. Current levels of inequality in income or wealth can represent historical patterns in the distribution of assets or opportunities.
