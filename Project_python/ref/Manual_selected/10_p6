Low-income households suffer a disproportionate share of disaster impacts and people living in multidimensional poverty are likely to live in hazard-exposed areas and are
less able to invest in risk-reduction measures. Disasters hit hardest the most marginalized, notably children, older persons and persons with disabilities. Extensive risk particularly affects areas already characterized by social inequality and exclusion,
where a deficit of infrastructure is an underlying source of vulnerability and loss of this further aggravates the situation. In villages affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami the death rate was highest for young children and older persons, and was 40% higher for women than for men. Following the Great Tohoku earthquake in Japan in 2011, the
death rate in Miyagi region amongst the total population of the coastal area was 0.8 %, while it reached 3.5 % amongst persons with disabilities.
