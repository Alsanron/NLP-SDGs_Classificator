This chapter starts with setting out the scope of social expenditure and then summarises the prevalence of statutory social protection provisions across countries. The third section discusses issues around the extension the coverage of social protection benefits among elderly citizens considering pensions, non contributory benefits as well as the Singaporean provident fund. Section 2.4 looks at the ADBs Social Protection Indicator to glean some insight in the extent to which richer and poorer countries devote resources to social expenditure and whether or not they are able to reach potential beneficiaries. This discussion illustrates the importance of different components of social spending (e.g., social insurance, social assistance, and active labour market programmes); and, the poverty and gender dimensions of distributional impacts of social spending.
