Experience shows that strong, well functioning, adaptable and adequately funded social systems are essential to cope with the negative impacts of crises like COVID 19. This case study examines the strengths and weaknesses of social systems in Africa and how these influenced the response of different countries. It notes that few countries have adequate social protection schemes, but some countries have limited the direct effects of the pandemic by relying on health emergency systems honed during the Ebola outbreak. Building stronger social systems, the authors argue, builds resilience.
