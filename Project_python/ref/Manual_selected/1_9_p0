Over the past decades, although global poverty has been reduced, income inequality is rising, which is a source of concern in terms, among other things, of social tensions
and exclusion. Only about 10% of the total wealth in most countries is in the hands of the poorest half of the population. The available evidence suggests that wage income from
industrial employment has helped greatly in pulling large sections of the population out of poverty. UNIDO offers evidence from successful developing countries suggesting
that economic growth and transformation triggered by industrialization, international trade and related services have contributed to poverty eradication and inequality
reduction. Multidimensional poverty and industrialization The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) depicted in reflects the prevalence of multidimensional deprivation at the household and individual level in health, education and standard of living. A person is considered multi-dimensionally poor if he or she suffers deprivations in a third of the weighted indicators of the index. According to UNDP, more than 30% of the populations in the countries covered (corresponding to 75% of the world total) experienced such a multitude of deprivations between 2005 and 2012. The strong negative correlation between the MPI and the Competitive Industrial Performance Index (CIP) indicates that in countries with very competitive industries, multidimensional poverty is low.
