the government will work to ensure that finland is carbon neutral by 2035 and carbon negative soon after that we will do this by accelerating emissions reduction measures and strengthening carbon sinks the government is committed to reforming the climate policies of the european union and finland so that we can do our part to limit the global mean temperature increase to 15 degrees celsius finland aims to develop the eus longterm climate measures so that the eu can achieve carbon neutrality before 2050 this means tightening the emissions reduction obligation for 2030 to at least 55 per cent below the 1990 emissions level we will continue our nordic climate and energy cooperation in order to achieve carbon neutrality and will work to strengthen the position of the nordic countries as leaders in international climate policy we will decide on the additional actions needed to bring finlands emissions reduction path in line with the goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2035 we will strengthen the role of the climate change act as a guiding instrument we will amend the act in a way that will enable us to achieve the target of carbon neutrality by 2035 we will also update the target for 2050 in the climate change act we will add emissions reduction targets for 2030 and 2040 to the act in line with our path to carbon neutrality we will also include the land use sector in the act and set a target for strengthening carbon sinks we will carry out an assessment of our carbon neutrality target in 2025 the assessment will take into account factors including new scientific data technological development and the emissions commitments of other countries along with the possibility of adopting international flexibility in meeting the targetswe will update our medium term climate change policy plan and national climate and energy strategy so we can reach the 2030 emissions reduction level required to achieve carbon neutrality we will evaluate our solutions based on their efficiency and cost effectiveness while also taking into account regional differences and impacts on employment emissions reduction measures will be carried out in a way that is fair from a social and regional perspective and that involves all sectors of society we will establish a ministerial working group on climate and energy issues which will be in charge of preparing climate policy as a whole assessing climate impacts will become a part of the normal process of drafting legislation the government will establish a round table on climate policy in connection with the sustainable development committee by bringing together a variety of operators in society we can ensure that our climate actions are in the best interests of society and have broad approval from the publicthe government will assist local and regional authorities in preparing their own carbon neutrality plans and implementing climate actions we will strengthen the role of the finnish climate panel as an independent scientific expert body and allocate sufficient resources for it
