The gains in well-being in countries in the LAC region between 2000 and 2019 were considerable. However, the pace of progress has slowed considerably since the mid-2010s. Further, many of the natural, human, social and economic capital resources that underpin the sustainability of well-being were already under threat or in decline before the pandemic, and structural problems such as high levels of informality and inequalities persisted to 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic risks reversing many of the well-being gains achieved in recent decades, as well as deepening pre-existing challenges. A well-being approach to policy would support LAC countries in addressing the highly interconnected societal challenges they face, but mainstreaming a well-being approach in Latin America will require broad public and political support, as well as institutional mechanisms that anchor well-being priorities into long-term government operations. Improvements in data on all policy-relevant aspects of well-being are also needed.
