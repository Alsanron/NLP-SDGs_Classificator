Environmental degradation is one of the main drivers of disaster risk. Natural ecosystems can reduce vulnerability to natural hazards and extreme climatic events and complement, or substitute for, more expensive infrastructure investments. Communities dependent on fragile or degraded landscapes – such as overgrazed, heavily deforested or severely eroded lands – are often the most vulnerable to losses from natural hazards. The effects of land degradation are often irreversible. Modeling for the Seychelles suggests wave energy has doubled partially as a result of changes in the structure (due to bleaching) and species composition of coral reefs. In the Caribbean, more than 15,000 kilometers of shoreline could experience a 10–20 percent reduction in protection from waves and storms by 2050 as a result of reef degradation. Dense vegetation protects riverbanks and adjacent land and structures from erosion by floodwaters. In Mantadia National
Park, Madagascar, conversion from primary forest to swidden can increase downstream storm flow by as much as 4.5 times. In Africa, 52 per cent of land is considered degraded to some degree.
