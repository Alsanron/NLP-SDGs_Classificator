The fishing industry is a primary example for an industry subject to natures variability, including climate change. Climate change affects fisheries along two main axes, changes in productivity in a given location and changes in fish migrations or the location of their habitats. Based on IPPC reports and other sources the paper summarizes expected changes in the marine environment. It then looks into potential fisheries productivity implications by drawing on examples from changes that occurred in the past. The paper also outlines the impacts of changing fish migration patterns of shared stocks, again illustrated by examples from the past. Those changes can influence the behaviour of the partners exploiting a shared stock, with critical consequences for the status of the stock and/or the relationships between the partners of an agreement. The paper further illustrates that if those changes affect stocks located entirely or partially in the high seas, shared management through RFMOs becomes even more challenging.
