Efficient network and innovation infrastructure are key pillars of business environment. Their accessibility, reliability and affordability are particularly critical for SMEs to compete in just-in-time and knowledge-intensive production systems, to raise their business profile and to scale up internal capacity. Yet, smaller firms are at disadvantage in accessing this infrastructure. They also weather infrastructure deficiencies less well than larger firms. This chapter presents recent developments in transport, energy, digital and R&D infrastructure across the OECD and emerging economies. It explains how network infrastructure has gained in reach, speed and sophistication, how global R&D capacity has grown, more concentrated but more open, and how these changes can affect future SME performance. The report also examines issues relevant to SME business, including increased network interdependency and cybersecurity, 5G deployment and technology adoption, micro-grids and energy decentralisation, shared mobility and the automation of transport systems. The chapter concludes with the main policy approaches adopted in countries to upgrade infrastructure, e.g. by addressing the investment gap, better co-ordinating multi-level government efforts, building smart cities and strategic public-private partnerships, or strengthening international co-operation, and to promote SME access to tomorrows infrastructure.
