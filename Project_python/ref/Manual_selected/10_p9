Over a billion people are estimated to live with some form of impairment. They remain among the most marginalized in most societies due to a lack of disability sensitive and responsive policy interventions, barriers like stigma and discrimination as well as inaccessible physical and virtual environments, such as communication devices
and transportation methods, and segregated educational institutions. Accessibility and inclusion are fundamental human rights for persons with disabilities, and are critical to
empowering persons with disabilities to live independently, be included in their communities, and to participate in and make contributions to society and development on an equal basis with others. In essence, the issue of accessibility and inclusion is a critical starting point that Parliaments and the global community have to take up by in order to incorporate persons with disabilities and their needs. Parliaments have been critical channels for promoting the rights for persons with disabilities through implementing frameworks such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 in the United States of America and the Disability Discrimination Act of 1995 in the United Kingdom. One
important achievement at the global level was the adoption of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
