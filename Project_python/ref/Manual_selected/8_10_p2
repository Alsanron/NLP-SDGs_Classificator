 Specific child and family benefit programmes rooted in legislation exist in 108 countries, yet often cover only small groups of the population. In 75 countries, no such programmes are available at all. Worldwide, less than 40 per cent of women in employment are covered by law under mandatory maternity cash benefit schemes; per cent if voluntary coverage (mainly for women in selfemployment) is included. Due to ineffective enforcement and implementation of the law in some regions, effective coverage is even lower. An increasing number of countries are using non-contributory maternity cash benefits as a means to improve income security and access to maternal and child health care for pregnant women and new mothers, particularly for women living in poverty. However, significant gaps remain. In many countries with high shares of informal employment, pensions are accessible only to a minority. Under existing laws and regulations, only 42 per cent of people of working age today can expect to receive contributory or noncontributory social security pensions from contributory schemes in the future, and effective coverage is likely to be even lower. Many countries have recently made efforts to expand the coverage of contributory pension schemes and to establish non-contributory pensions to guarantee at least basic income security guarantee in old age to all. With rapid ageing of the population in many countries, pension systems will face considerable pressure in the future.
