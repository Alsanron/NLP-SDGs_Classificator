The Road and Rail Infrastructure in Asia: Investing in Quality report addresses the need for greater attention to be paid to investing in quality infrastructure in Asian countries. It includes an introduction to the main issues, illustrated through case studies on recent road and rail infrastructure (Chapter 1) and discussions of three key policy areas to be addressed in developing and implementing quality infrastructure: the roles and responsibilities of local governments (Chapter 2), financing options for infrastructure projects (Chapter 3), and the alignment of transport infrastructure planning with development strategies (Chapter 4).
