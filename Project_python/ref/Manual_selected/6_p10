Floods, droughts and windstorms are the most frequently occurring natural disaster events and account for almost 90% of the 1,000 most disastrous events since 1990. Lack of basic services and sanitation combined with disasters can also create new risks, for example by turning a heavy rain into a disastrous flood with the spread of disease. Disasters, particularly localised, small-scale events, hinder progress in achieving universal access to water and sanitation by damaging sewerage and water supply infrastructure.
