Harmful alcohol use is a pressing public health issue and a key driver of non-communicable diseases, injuries and premature deaths. This chapter brings together the main messages of this publication and describes the policy implications identified by new OECD analyses of the health, social and economic burden of alcohol-related diseases. It presents trends and projections for up to 52 OECD, Group of 20 (G20) and European Union (EU27) countries, and makes a strong economic case for upscaling investment in policies to tackle harmful alcohol consumption. The chapter presents the expected effectiveness, impact on health expenditure and return on investment for ten policy interventions and four policy packages aimed at addressing harmful alcohol use. It concludes by analysing the potential impact public health policies may have on the industry and approaches to mitigate costs.
