harmful alcohol use is a pressing public health issue and a key driver of non communicable diseases, injuries and premature deaths. this chapter brings together the main messages of this publication and describes the policy implications identified by new oecd analyses of the health, social and economic burden of alcohol related diseases. it presents trends and projections for up to 52 oecd, group of 20 (g20) and european union (eu27) countries, and makes a strong economic case for upscaling investment in policies to tackle harmful alcohol consumption. the chapter presents the expected effectiveness, impact on health expenditure and return on investment for ten policy interventions and four policy packages aimed at addressing harmful alcohol use. it concludes by analysing the potential impact public health policies may have on the industry and approaches to mitigate costs. latvia sees high rates of obesity, smoking and alcohol consumption. in turn, this results in a high incidence of preventable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and many cancers. this puts a burden on a health system which is already operating on a very tight budget as compared to other oecd countries. this oecd report shows that latvia has many of the policies it needs to address these problems in place. however, latvia needs to go further to ensure the health system can effectively prevent diseases, not just cure them. this will require redesigning policies to reach a larger population and efforts to educate the population to understand how to protect their health. better screening programmes are needed, as is a stronger primary care sector, and access to essential medicines for all latvians.
