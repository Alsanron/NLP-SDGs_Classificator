The following illustrative examples underline the
importance of oceans, seas and marine resources for
human well-being. Over 3 billion people depend on marine and coastal resources for their livelihoods. 131 Fish provide 4.3 billion people with at least 15% of their
intake of animal protein. At least 90% of the volume of global trade is seaborne. Approximately 50% of all international tourists travel to coastal areas. In some developing countries, notably Small Island Developing States (SIDS), tourism can account for over 25% of GDP.134 The global oceans-based economy is estimated at between USD 3-6 trillion/year. Oceans capture and store about 30% of carbon dioxide produced by humans. Mangroves and coral reefs offer shoreline protection. Global coral reefs protect around 150,000 km of shoreline in more than 100 countries and territories. Marine phytoplankton produces 50% of oxygen on
Earth. The link between oceans, seas and marine resources and human well-being is not one-sided. While an increase in human well-being is frequently generated at the cost of ecosystem integrity, it can also potentially reduce the negative anthropogenic impacts on the marine environment
