Disasters tend to have the greatest long-term impacts on those people in the poorest income quartile or quintile, although lack of data and research on long-term effects of disasters at house-hold level makes analysis of the
complicated linkages between disasters and impoverishment difficult. Impoverishment is linked to lack of access to markets, capital, assets, and social security and insurance mechanisms that can help people to cope and to rebuild. Disasters affect disproportionally the poor at global level;  high-income countries account for 39% of the exposure to tropical cyclones but only 1% of the mortality. Low-income countries represent 13% of the exposure but no less than 81% of the mortality. Taking on risks and proactively managing them is a natural element of development and economic growth, and risk assessments and DRR planning should be integrated in investment
planning at all levels
