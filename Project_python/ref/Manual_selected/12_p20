Norway now has a simpler regulatory framework for waste management and is striving to reduce the significant increase in waste generation that it has experienced since the last OECD review. Efforts have been made to make the selective collection and treatment of household waste more cost-effective, and to improve the safety of landfill operations. The chapter also presents progress in reducing emissions of hazardous chemical substances, many of which were linked with disposal of end-of-life products, as well as addressing problems related to contaminated sites. Concerns remain however, over the volumes of hazardous waste and waste transfer across Norways borders. How to effectively use the mix of instruments in managing waste, along with better implementation of waste management plans, is examined in this chapter, along with best ways of dealing with tax and other incentives that can improve performance.
