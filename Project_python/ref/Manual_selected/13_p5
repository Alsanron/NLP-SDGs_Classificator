Technology is essential for effective risk governance, especially for the complex and potentially systemic hazards stemming from climate change. An understanding of the risks and current and future impacts of climate change is needed before developing and implementing approaches to reduce and manage the associated risks of losses and damages. Observation and modelling of the climate system and forecasting capabilities can inform the characterisation of risks. Technologies will provide the underpinning for evaluating risks, as well as developing approaches to reduce and manage those risks. As risks are always evolving, an iterative process of monitoring, evaluation and learning can inform both understanding and management of the risks over time.
