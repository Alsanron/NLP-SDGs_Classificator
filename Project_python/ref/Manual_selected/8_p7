Job retention schemes have been the main instrument used in most OECD countries for stemming the labour market impact of the COVID 19 crisis. This chapter provides a preliminary assessment of their impact during the crisis. It offers four key contributions: i) an institutional analysis of the main features of job retention schemes; ii) a statistical portrait of their use and determinants; iii) a discussion of their possible effects on job retention and job creation during the COVID 19 crisis based on the available preliminary evidence; iv) a comprehensive discussion of the policy challenge of promoting job retention while supporting transitions to jobs in firms and sectors with better growth prospects. The main message is that well-designed job retention schemes can be an effective policy tool to help the labour market weather an economic downturn: they need to be timely, targeted and temporary to support workers and firms effectively while minimising unintended negative effects on job creation and growth.
