Safe water and adequate sanitation are vital to individual health, livelihood and well-being. Yet, more than one out of four people in the world, around 2 billion people, do not have access to basic sanitation services. A lack of access to basic sanitation can lead to transmission of different diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera and hepatitis A -, and adds to the burden of malnutrition. Better access to water and sanitation could prevent the deaths of 297000 children under age 5 annually (WHO, 2019[28]). Improving access contributes not only to better health but also leads to great social and economic benefits, whether through higher educational participation, improved living standards, lower health care costs or a more productive labour force. Consequently, the United Nations has set a target of achieving universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all, as well as achieving access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation by 2030. Furthermore, UNICEF s strategy for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) 2016â€‘30 seeks to ensure that every child lives in a clean and safe environment, gains access to basic sanitation and safe drinking water in early childhood development centres, school, health centres and in humanitarian situations (UNICEF, 2018[29]).
