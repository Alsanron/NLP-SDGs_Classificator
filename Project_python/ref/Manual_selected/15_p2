Changes in the biophysical characteristics of natural habitats that can be measured with data on land cover are the best proxy to monitor pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity. This paper presents a suite of indicators that track land cover change over time in a globally consistent manner. The indicators, including an OECD Green Growth headline indicator, represent the Organisation's most recent effort to monitor pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity, using state of the art data and techniques. Results are presented for OECD and G20 countries over 1992 2015 using global multi period datasets.
