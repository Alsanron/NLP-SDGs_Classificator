Restoration and protection of water related ecosystems that underpin the provision of freshwater supplies. Extension of networks to provide universal coverage of drinking water
services. Water tariffs and associated subsidies (consumption, direct, connection
subsidies). Strategies that aim to provide universal access to safe drinking water are directly geared to leaving no one behind. However, extension of networks usually does not reach those furthest behind first. Many countries have met the MDG target relating to drinking water; yet, many still do not have access to an improved drinking water source.
Water subsidies have often been found to be regressive; they do not reach those not
connected to the network. In countries where the majority of the population has physical access, strategies to facilitate affordability of water become the main channel to reach those furthest behind. To the extent that those furthest behind live farthest from areas already served, strategies to extend water provisions may not spontaneously reach the furthest behind first. Doing so requires a deliberate prioritization of the most underserved areas and groups.
