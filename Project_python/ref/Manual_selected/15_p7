The urgent need to reduce carbon emissions from forest loss prompted the international community to negotiate the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This collaborative mechanism is designed to provide incentives for developing countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their forest and peatland sectors. A broad range of stakeholders governments, multilateral organisations, civil society, indigenous groups and other forest-dependent communities, academia and the private sector are included in all REDD+ planning and implementation processes. This chapter describes how REDD+ works and draws out some common denominators among the partnerships it promotes.This chapter also includes an opinion piece by Bharrat Jagdeo, former President of Guyana.
