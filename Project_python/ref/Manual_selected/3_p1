this calls for urgent action in monitoring closely recent trends in mortality and incidence, and identifying the underlying causes. currently, unhealthy diets make the largest contribution to the population level cvd mortality burden, with over 40% of cvd deaths being attributed to dietary factors, and prevalence of overweight, obesity and diabetes is on the rise. in other words, we have not reached the point where no more gains can be achieved in cardiovascular mortality, and especially in premature mortality. antimicrobial resistance (amr) is a biological mechanism whereby a microorganism evolves over time to develop the ability to become resistant to antimicrobial therapies such as antibiotics. the drivers of and potential solutions to amr are complex, often spanning multiple sectors. the internationally recognized response to amr advocates for a one health approach, which requires policies to be developed and implemented across human, animal, and environmental health.
