This chapter describes the ecosystem services that several economic sectors obtain from the marine environment. It examines the pressures on Swedens marine environment and the status of marine ecosystems, habitats and species. The chapter describes Swedens institutional and policy framework for the conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment. Finally, it presents how the ecosystem approach is integrated into Swedens marine policy, including through marine spatial planning and protected areas.
