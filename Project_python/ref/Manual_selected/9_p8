The quality of infrastructure cannot be judged entirely in isolation, and also requires that projects complement broader development strategies where they are implemented. However, weak public investment management systems can lead to investments that are less fiscally sustainable and unlikely to make effective contributions to growth and development. Similarly, appraisal systems are critical in identifying quality infrastructure projects, as are institutions for infrastructure governance. VietNam, which has adopted many principles of quality infrastructure through its planning system, offers an interesting case study, though further work could be done to strengthen the connections between socio-economic development plans and transport planning. Detailed budgeting, time-specific targets, and clearer criteria, could be helpful in addressing these challenges.
