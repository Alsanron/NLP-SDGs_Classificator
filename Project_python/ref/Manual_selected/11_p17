Chiles urban governance architecture has provided a solid framework for urban development, but it may no longer be adequate to meet the pressures of continued rapid urbanisation. Improving Chiles urban outcomes will require adjusting its urban governance framework, including building the capacity to bring central and sub-national, public and private actors together to build a whole-of-city approach to urban initiatives. This chapter focuses on Chiles urban administrative structures, recent sub-national reforms and sub-national financing practices. It analyses the administrative and institutional fragmentation affecting urban governance and explores institutionally based governance models, including those for metropolitan areas. Finally, it examines mechanisms to reinforce strategic planning and public service delivery capacity based on the countrys own context and international experience.
