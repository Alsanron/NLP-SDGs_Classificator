Report on limiting global warming to 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels considered different scenarios for reaching that objective:95 all require net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 and concurrent deep reductions in non-CO2 greenhouse gas (particularly methane)
emissions, with global reductions beginning soon. The scenarios studied were all consistent with the continuing improvement in peopleâ€™s lives across the globe but differ markedly in how the reductions in emissions will be achieved. One scenario is a pathway that assumes a continuing widespread adoption of greenhouse-gas-intensive lifestyles, with high demand for transportation fuels and livestock products. Achieving the global warming target (with a significant overshoot above 1.5 o C warming) would only be possible through a rapid and large-scale deployment of technologies that remove CO2 from the atmosphere. However, although technologies that can do so are under development, none as yet exist at the scale needed for the required impact. Most of those technologies could have significant impacts on land, energy, water or nutrients if deployed at large scale, and may have significant impacts on agricultural and food systems, biodiversity, and other ecosystem functions and services. In this scenario, final energy demand in
2030 is 39 per cent higher than in 2010, and agricultural methane emissions are 14 per cent higher over the same time period.
