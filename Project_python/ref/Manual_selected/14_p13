In order for oceans, seas and marine resources to
successfully contribute to human well-being, ecosystem
integrity130, with properly functioning biogeochemical and physical processes, is required. This does not require unperturbed systems, but systems that have not suffered serious or irreversible harm. Ecosystem integrity allows for the provision of supporting ecosystem services which, in turn, are the bases of important regulating, provisioning and cultural ecosystem services that are of crucial importance for humans. Whereas the benefits provided by oceans, seas and marine resources are important to all people, vulnerable groups, including the poor and indigenous peoples, with a high dependency on natural resources and ecosystem services may have their wellbeing especially tied to these benefits.
