plasma carcinoembryonic antigen cea and serum enzyme levels of PHI phi gammaglutamyl transpeptidase psigtp and lactate dehydrogenase ldh were measured in patients with malignancy levels were higher in patients particularly with gi breast and lung cancers than in normals or in patients with CA in clinical remission elevations of cea and of all three enzymes in blood were most frequent in patients with hepatic metastases cea elevations correlated directly with phi levels seventyeight percent of patients with M1 gi cancer could be identified by cea greater than ngml alone as well as with breast cancer and with lung cancer but only of other cancers could be identified by cea alone cea or one or more enzymes was elevated in of metastatic breast cancer patients of lung cancer and of other cancers but enzyme measurement did not increase ID of gi CA over that achieved by cea alone these findings suggest that circulating C2 of cea phi psigtp and ldh may reflect a direct contribution from the malignant tissue andor liver malfunction secondary to liver replacement. a report is given on the recent discovery of outstanding immunological properties in ba ncyanoethyleneurea having a low molecular mass m experiments in ds CS bearing wistar rats have shown that ba at a dosage of only about percent ld mg kg and negligible lethality percent results in a REC rate of percent without hyperglycemia and in one test of percent with hyperglycemia under otherwise unchanged conditions the REF substance ifosfamide
