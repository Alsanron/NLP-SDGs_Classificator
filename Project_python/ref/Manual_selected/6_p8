An uncertain future for freshwater, the potentially rapid pace of change and the existence of possible irreversible tipping points increases the value of flexibility and calls for a dynamic, future-oriented approach to water governance and policy. This chapter highlights how adaptive water governance is gaining attention as a means to increase flexibility and deal with uncertainty related to long-term trends. It highlights how well-designed economic instruments can improve the efficiency and timeliness of adaptation responses by reducing baseline stress on water resources and providing flexibility to deal with increased variability, risks, and uncertainty. Based on a number of case studies it draws out lessons for adaptation on the use of insurance schemes, water trading, water pricing, and ecosystem-based approaches. Finally, the chapter examines some of the potential pitfalls in financing adaptation for water and looks at how a real options approach can be used to value flexibility in long-term investments.
