Antofagastas rapid growth has accentuated the need to quickly and effectively address complex urban policy issues, including economic competitiveness, urban infrastructure, environmental quality and connectivity. There is a strong movement in Antofagasta to ensure that the city is prepared for its future and can provide a higher quality of life for its residents. Yet the ability to manage the challenges ahead and engage in a vibrant process of transformation is constrained by public governance institutions and frameworks that are not adapted to Antofagastas dynamic context. This chapter explores some of Antofagastas governance challenges, particularly with respect to financial and human resources, to the development and implementation of a comprehensive strategic vision, and to the role of citizens and external stakeholders in public service delivery. The chapter makes a call for greater innovation in sub-national government and governance to support the city as it moves forward in realising its aims.
