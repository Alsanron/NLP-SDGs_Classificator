This chapter focuses on how actual and perceived inequality shape preferences for redistribution. It shows that demand for redistribution is closely related to concern over income disparities and what underlies them, i.e. perceptions of and preferences for economic inequality. Changes in actual inequality, as measured by conventional indicators, are associated with changes in demand for redistribution, but only as long as changes in concern evolve in the same direction. The effect of changes in inequality on demand for redistribution reflects both changes in relative income by making some people poorer and thus more favourable to government intervention and peoples own preferences for the aggregate level of inequality. Despite being related to inequality, demand for redistribution has increased only mildly over time and reacted only to a limited extent to rises in concerns and inequality. The chapter assesses possible explanations, based on observational evidence and a review of survey experiments.
