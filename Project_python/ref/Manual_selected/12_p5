A new national strategy for circular economy, adopted in September 2018, and the subsequent political agreement aim to provide new impetus for alternative business models that put resource efficiency, waste prevention and recycling at the heart of production and consumption. This chapter gives an overview of trends in material use and waste generation, and of related policies. It reviews the effectiveness of instruments used to encourage waste prevention, reduction and recycling, and identifies implementation gaps and opportunities in moving towards a circular economy.
