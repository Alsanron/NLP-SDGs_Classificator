Managing and securing access to water for all requires not only a question of financing, but equally a matter of good governance. While many of the solutions to meeting the water challenge (such as water pricing, water markets, financial planning) do exist and are relatively well-known, the rate of take-up of these solutions by governments in OECD and non-OECD countries has been uneven. Some countries have undertaken very innovative and sophisticated reforms while others seem to be hamstring by significant obstacles to reform. A major challenge lays in the implementation of these solutions, tailoring them to local contexts, overcoming obstacles to reform, and bringing together the main actors from different sectors to join forces and share the risks and tasks. This chapter highlights the key governance challenges confronting water policy reform, focusing on the issues arising from the multi-level governance structure that generally characterises water resources management.
