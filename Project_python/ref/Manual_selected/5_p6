Colombia has made major strides in the past two decades towards designing and delivering policies that foster gender equality. It has ratified all international treaties on womens rights, and has updated its laws to reflect those commitments. Colombias Quota Law of 2000 establishes that women must hold at least 30% of top decision-making positions in the public administration, while its Electoral Reform Law of 2011 stipulates that women must represent at least 30% of the candidates on party lists in elections. Colombia produced a National Policy on Gender Equality in 2013. Moreover, the National Development Plan 2018-22 includes a chapter on womens rights based on three dimensions: economic, political and physical integrity, including violence against women. The country is currently implementing a ten-year plan to improve access to justice that is helping national and subnational authorities co-ordinate common goals, including the protection of womens rights.
