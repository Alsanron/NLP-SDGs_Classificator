Bioenergy solutions, including waste-to-energy applications, make up a diverse landscape of technologies and feedstocks that can be used for heat and power generation, amongst other uses like biofuels for transport. Abundant residues in Colombia, from livestock and agriculture as well as municipal and industrial waste can be used to meet the country clean energy ambitions, alongside other socioeconomic and environmental goals such as reduced emissions and limiting waste going to landfills. Bioenergy solutions, like the current use of waste residues for energy generation in Colombia sugarcane and palm industries, can address heavy reliance on fossil fuels and the country growing dependence on energy imports. Tapping into locally available waste can equally support ambitions to provide clean, reliable and affordable energy, for instance in zones not connected to the national grid. Yet, unlocking opportunities for these solutions will require co-ordinated action to create the enabling environment for bioenergy finance and investment.
