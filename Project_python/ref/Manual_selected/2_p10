Nutrition. Promotion of breastfeeding and nutrition for pregnant/breastfeeding women and adolescent girls. Promotion of complementary feeding with or without provision of food supplements. Micronutrient interventions. General supportive strategies to family and community nutrition. Reduction of disease burden. Interventions are usually delivered as universal programmes targeting pregnant and lactating women, adolescent girls, infants and young children. Nutrition interventions that focus on the furthest behind, such as the therapeutic feeding for children suffering from severe acute malnutrition, are particularly effective when compared with other strategies. However, because stunting is difficult to reverse after 36 months of age, in some contexts, universal programmes before that critical age have been proven more successful than targeted interventions later in life.
