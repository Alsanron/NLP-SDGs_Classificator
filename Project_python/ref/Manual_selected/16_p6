Open government is a culture of governance that does not only apply to the executive branch of the state, but that can apply to all state institutions. Despite most open government initiatives worldwide focusing on the executive, countries are designing specific strategies and initiatives for an open judiciary, open parliament, open subnational government and open independent institutions, or are even adopting an open state approach. Costa Rica for example signed the first-ever Declaration for the Creation of an Open State in 2016, and Colombia is the first country to elaborate an Open State Policy (OECD, 2019[6]). An open state is when all public institutions of the executive, parliament and the judiciary, independent public institutions, and all levels of government join forces and collaborate with civil society, academia, the media and the private sector to design and implement a reform agenda to make public governance more transparent, accountable and participatory (OECD, 2016[2]).The OECD therefore recommends that states promote a progressive move from the concept of open government towards that of open state, while recognising the respective roles, prerogatives and overall independence of all concerned parties (OECD, 2016[2]).
