However, the existence of actions and programmes in mental health promotion and prevention is uneven both between countries, and across different points of the life course. Many countries could stand to scale up their promotion and prevention efforts in the mental health field, and further efforts are particularly needed to introduce interventions targeted at unemployed and older populations. Mental ill health is a significant issue in Sweden, with both mild to moderate and severe disorders representing a significant burden of ill health. Mild and moderate mental health problems constitute the greatest number of cases, and such disorders have been on the rise over the past several decades. However, mental ill health is also recognised as a vital national issue by Swedish authorities. Accordingly, Sweden has a relatively comprehensive approach to mental health as part of its universal health plan. Sweden was also at the forefront of such trends as deinstitutionalisation and official suicide prevention programs. Country specific initiatives designed to tackle the most pressing psychological problems in Sweden are in place, including suicide, societal stigma and rising levels of mental problems amongst Swedish youth and workers. Cancer was the second leading cause of death in OECD countries after circulatory diseases, accounting for 24% of all deaths in 2019. Leading causes of cancer related mortality included lung cancer (21%), colorectal cancer (11%), breast cancer (15% among women) and prostate cancer (10% among men). These four represent 44% of all cancers diagnosed in OECD countries. Mortality rates from cancer have fallen in all OECDÃ‚ countries since 2000, although on average the decline has been more modest than for circulatory diseases.
