In a global context of rarefaction of water resources, climate change and economic recession, many challenges can be overcome through efficient governance. Peculiarly, there is a need for better co-ordination among actors in charge of water policy design and implementation at central and sub-central government levels. Despite the diversity of national systems, MENA countries experiences in reforming water policies have underlined common concerns undermining the efficient implementation of water policies, i.e. unclear, fragmented and overlapping responsibilities; lack of capacity and financing; and insufficient stakeholders participation. Even with the need for locally tailored policies, a regional shared vision is required to benefit from common understanding. This chapter analyses water governance challenges in the MENA region and discusses the reforms underway in four countries in terms of regulation and private sector participation (Egypt), river basin organisation and citizens involvement (Morocco), development of a legal framework (Palestinian National Authority) and integrated water resources management (Tunisia).
