Over the last decade, Japan has shifted from a waste management policy to an integrated waste and material management approach that promotes dematerialisation and resource efficiency. Landfill shortage and dependency on natural resources imports have been key drivers of these changes. This chapter analyses progress achieved in building a sound material-cycle society based on the 3Rs (reduce, reuse and recycle). With international movement of recyclables developing rapidly, loopholes have appeared in Japans advanced recycling system. This chapter examines steps taken to promote and spread the 3Rs strategy in Asia, and to prevent illegal transboundary movements of waste.
