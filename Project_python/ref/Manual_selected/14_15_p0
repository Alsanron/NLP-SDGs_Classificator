Biodiversity loss is among the top global risks to society. The planet is now facing its sixth mass extinction, with consequences that will affect all life on Earth, both now and for millions of years to come. Humans have destroyed or degraded vast areas of the world terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems. Natural forests declined by hectares per year between 2010 and 2015 (in total, an area larger than the U.K.), and natural wetlands declined by 35% between 1970 and 2015. Over 30% of corals are now at risk from bleaching, and 60% of vertebrate populations have disappeared since 1970. These striking changes are driven by land-use change, over-exploitation of natural resources, pollution, invasive alien species and climate change. They are occurring in spite of international efforts (such as the Convention on Biological Diversity) to conserve and sustainably use biodiversity.
